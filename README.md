# Location-based_offline-mobile-routing-application

I have done this project under Department of Space(ISRO) during smart India Hackathon Where we have got Rank 7 in India

This is actually the client side application of the the <a href="https://github.com/hpkaushik121/Android-GIS-server-master">Android-GIS-server-master</a>

It will send the a request to the server in form of text and receive the information of the direction in the form of text and this all will be offline
no internet connection is required
